								<p>Genjee was not far from Mani's relatives in the Villupuram district. Mani's tutor discussed crops that originated outside of India and suggested eating locally farmed produce. His parents informed him that a lot of traders sailed to India in search of spices, particularly black pepper. Vasco da Gama, a Portuguese trader, travelled to Kerala in search of spices and brought spices from India. In a similar manner, they brought many of their native vegetables to India. Instead of sailing to India, Christopher Columbus chose South America, where he discovered the Americas and the chilli. The Portuguese were responsible for bringing chillies to India.</p>

								<p>Raj Arumugam wrote the cute poem "I dream of spices." The poem's narrator is a young child named Raj. One day his mother requested him to go to Muthu's store and purchase some cinnamon, betel leaves, ginger, and garlic. While walking to the store, he sung songs with joy and daydreamed about the spices. He completely forgot his list when Muthu asked him what he wanted to buy and recited a fresh one. He declared that he desired pickles, onions, tomatoes, and sesame seeds! When he returned home with the incorrect list of groceries, his mother twisted his ears, and he shouted out in agony, "Ouch."</p>

										<h2>The spider and the fly</h2>
										<p>A spider tries to lure a fly into its home.</p>

								<p>There was was a spider that used its web to draw prey. When a fly passed by, the spider made the decision to capture it. The spider invited the fly to his parlour by referring to his web as a parlour or any typical residence. The spider remarked that its web is one of the most exquisite parlours anyone has ever seen, equating it to a house. The fly was summoned to the spider's home by the spiral staircase. The spider tries to draw the fly in by claiming that if the fly were to enter, the parlour would have a lot of interesting things to exhibit.</p>
                                <p>The little fly became alarmed and declared that it has no interest in entering the spider's den because it is aware that anyone who climbs the winding staircase has never returned. The spider continued by stating that it could comprehend the fly's fear. The spider declared that she could objectively take a little nap on the parlor's small bed. According to the spider, it has some lovely drapes, and the bedsheets are quite thin and nice. As a result, the spider claims that it is willing to take care of the fly if it wants to take a nap.</p>
                                <p>The tiny fly expressed its fear and said that it would not sleep inside the spider's chamber. The fly claimed to have frequently heard that people who fall asleep on the spider's bed never wake up.

The spider was incredibly intelligent and sly. It enquired of the fly what it could do to win the fly's favour and demonstrate its deep affection for the fly. The spider claims that its kitchen also contains some delicious treats. The spider therefore promised the fly that it would share those treats with it.

The fly objected once more, saying that while it appreciated the spider's gestures, it was not yet ready to see the treats the spider keeps in its pantry.</p>
                                                        
                                <p>The spider made every effort to draw the tiny fly. The spider described the tiny fly as a sweet creature that was both bright and amusing. The spider praised the tiny fly's wings, remarking that they were extremely shiny and that the insect's tiny eyes were breathtaking. The little fly can enter the house and see how lovely it was thanks to the mirror on the shelf, the spider claimed.

All of this praise did not apply to the insect. She merely softly thanked the spider before expressing her want to leave and wishing him a nice morning. The fly announced that it will visit his home the following day.</p>
                                                        
                                <p>The spider waited inside his home because he was certain the tiny fly would return. So the spider set up his table and made a web in a corner to catch the tiny fly.

Back at the door, the spider started chanting for the tiny fly. Come fluttering inside the home on your lovely, pearl-studded wings that appear to be made of silver. Your purple and green clothing as well as the antennas on your head resemble a crown. His eyes are dull as lead, but the eyes are like gems.</p>
                                                        
                                <p>She approached the spider extremely closely as a result of his compliments. It was silly of the fly to believe the spider. When the spider spotted the tiny fly, she was overjoyed.
Finally, the spider tightly grasped the fly and would not let go. To get to its den, it pulled the fly up the steps. The fly was captured by the spider and never freed. The poet now advises everybody who has read this story to recognise that they should never fall for these kinds of flattering remarks. Keep your heart, eyes, and ears alert and ignore anyone who tries to flatter you with pointless words. The poem's main lesson is just that.</p>

                            <p>There are many reasons for using songs and rhymes in teaching English as a foreign language in primary schools. Naturally, “children really enjoy learning and singing songs” (Phillips 1993: 100) and have fun doing rhythmic activities while reciting rhymes. But there are deeper psychological, cultural and linguistic aspects.</p>
                            
                            <p>Children grow up with songs and rhymes and develop their first language by them. Apart from being the most important spoken language, songs and rhymes are the first experienced parts of communication in the children’s mother tongue.</p><p> They listen and react to nursery rhymes and finger games spoken and often acted by their parents. They go to sleep with lullabies sung by their closest care-givers or try to imitate little songs by babbling. So songs and rhymes give them an intimate feeling, a special connection with their human environment and influence the acquisition of their first language in an important way.</p>

                            <p>Analogous to the development of the mother tongue, the following points also support foreign language acquisition :</p>

<p>- music, rhythm and rhymes produce a positive live feeling</p>
<p>- they motivate to learn and to be active</p>
<p>- children do not understand all words but do not feel inhibited</p>
<p>- rhythm supports vocabulary and structure learning</p>

                            <p>ICT or Information and Communications Technology broadly refers to tools and services that handle and communicate information. Some of the most common examples of ICT are mobile phones and televisions.</p>

                            <p>ICT is widely used in our everyday life, and its need is ever-growing in the education sector. Images, audios, videos, presentations, or a combination of these used for teaching constitute ICT in education. So, ICT in education meaning would be using information and communication to improve the delivery of education in every way. </p>

                            <p>Technology in education isn’t something new, but not many have information about ICT in education industry. This is because ICT comes with several constraints, one of which is ensuring access to electronic devices for every kid. But with more institutes investing in ICT, the problem should soon be resolved.</p>
                            
                            <p>Today’s classrooms are full of young minds who are technologically conscious. By using a combination of audio-visual learning resources alongside the traditional blackboard, institutes can facilitate better learning opportunities for students.</p>

                            <p>For these children, electronic devices have become a way of life. By using ICT in classrooms, children can be eased into education using tools they are already familiar with.</p>

                            <p>Apart from making learning fun, there is a lot of impact of ICT in education, such as:</p>

                            <b>Education For Everyone</b>
                            <p>ICT provides the flexibility and availability of learning materials to all students. While all resources are available in classrooms, students can also access them outside schools. This especially benefits students who are slow learners or have learning disabilities. Such students can go over the lessons as many times as they need and understand their subjects thoroughly.</p>

                            <p>The availability of learning resources also benefits students who can’t afford to attend classes every day. For students with financial constraints, low-cost electronic devices specially meant for education are available.</p>

										<h2>ANCHOR CHARTS</h2>
										<p>A systematic way of creating charts by both the teacher and the students</p>

                                    <p>An anchor chart is a tool used to support instruction (i.e., “anchor” the learning for students). As you teach a lesson, you create a chart, together with your students, that captures the most important content and relevant strategies. Anchor charts build a culture of literacy in the classroom by making thinking—both the teacher’s and students’—visible.</p>
                                    <p>It’s easy to incorporate anchor charts into your lesson plans. All it takes is a clear purpose and some pre-planning.</p>

                                    <p>Typically, you will prepare the framework of your chart ahead of time, giving it a title, including the learning objective, and creating headers for the main points or strategies you want to highlight. It’s very important not to create the entire poster ahead of time. They are best used as an interactive tool with students.</p>
